These are some projects I did when I was at Roi Academy. Each of them had certain tasks that had to be accomplished. 

**USAGE & DESCRIPTION: (The folder - The technologies used)**

The 1st folder - groups the person in a certain category based on his age - HTML/CSS/JS
The 2nd folder - a simple, non-functional login & signup registration form + used only for the appearance - HTML/CSS
The 3rd folder - a list of portraits/images about different categories - HTML/CSS
The 4th folder (Part 1) - a registration system, uses the second folder login/signup appearance but is functionable because of PHP when the user can login/signup and see the details in a separate place and also log out when he needs it - + HTML/CSS for the design

The 4th folder (Part 2) - has a calculator, where the user is able to perform basic operations with numbers, and when the operation button is clicked after the numbers are entered, the result is shown on the screen - HTML/CSS/JS

**IMPORTANT TO NOTE:** Since the projects that involved PHP had to use XAMPP and had only one htdocs folder (cannot be duplicated), I put both of the projects in the same folder.

The files for the Part 1 in there are: **authenticate.php, icon-google.png, index.php, logout.php, main.css, main2.css, main3.css, profile.php, register-process.php, and register.php** and those for the Part 2 **calculator.php and calculatorstyle.css**.
XAMPP needs to be on so that the PHP projects are functional.
